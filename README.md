# Stock Picker

## Brief Description of Project
This Ruby mini-project accepts an array of stock prices and then determines the optimum days to buy and sell (with the goal of maximizing profit).

The buying day must be before the selling day.

## Example

```
stock_prices = [17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10]
stock_picker(stock_prices) # => "Buy on Day 1 for $3 and sell on Day 4 for $15. Profit is $12."

```

## What I Learned / Goals of Project

The purpose of this mini-project was to practice using basic Ruby syntax. It was also good practice at refactoring my code -- my first attempt was very messy and convoluted. The current iteration is much cleaner and readable.
